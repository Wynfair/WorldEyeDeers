    # lead acid or better battery banks and that power couild be measured,
    # then converted, and fed into the device.

      One 5 watt cell for 4 hours = 20 watts 
      but what if 1% of the whole world tried it?
      That would be 5,416,666.666666667 KILOWATT HOURS OF POWER! (5.416MW)
      AND at .09 per KWH that would equal $487,500 PER DAY!
      Prices vary by place! Some places charge $0.25 per KWH!

# Imagine all of the things we would be able to do! Want more money? Add more panels, make more power!
# And on and on. Green tax incentives may make a project like this very lucrative.
