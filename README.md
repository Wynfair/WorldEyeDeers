   THEORY
     IF everyone has a 5 Watt Solar cell connected to a small inverter charging, even lead acid battery banks, and that
     power couild be measured, then converted in a trickle, slow style fashion, then for like less than $100 we could 
     have small micro watt proofs of work happening on every computer or device in the world!
     Small battery pack, small solar cell, small power conversion, small savings, small calculation, small hash paid for by          YOUR PANEL, PROOF OF WORK! Imagine all of the things we would be able to do!
     Green tax incentives would make a project like this EXPLODE!
