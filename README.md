SOLAR PANELS - MICRO SOLAR PANELS, MICRO ENERGY GENERATION & Distribution Apps Theory

     Imagine everyone has a 5 Watt Solar cell connected to a small lead acid or better battery banks and that
     power couild be measured, then converted, and fed into the device.
     For less than $100 usd we could have small micro watt "proofs-of-work" 
     happening on every computer or device in the world!
     Small battery pack, small solar cell, small power conversion, small savings, small calculation, small hash paid for by          YOUR PANEL, PROOF OF WORK! Imagine all of the things we would be able to do! Want more money? Add more panels, make more        power, on and on.  Green tax incentives may make a project like this very lucrative.
