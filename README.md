     #Imagine everyone has a 5 Watt Solar cell connected to small lead acid or better battery banks and that
     #power couild be measured, then converted, and fed into the device.
     #For less than $100 usd we could have small micro watt "proofs-of-work" 
     #happening on every computer or device in the world!
     
# Small battery packs (Plenty of room for home research)

#     - Litium Ion - Aluminium Magnesium - Lead Acid
#     WE NEED APS THAT CAN MEASURE POWER LEVELS
     
# Small solar cells 

#     Easy Do-It-Yourself guides are EVERYWHERE for making these.
     
# small power conversion - how to make this more efficient?

# YOUR PROOF OF WORK! 

#     One 5 watt cell for 4 hours = 20 watts 
#     but what if 1% of the whole world tried it?
#     That would be 5,416,666.666666667 KILOWATT HOURS OF POWER! (5.416MW)
#     AND at .09 per KWH that would equal $487,500 PER DAY!
#     Prices vary by place! Some places charge $0.25 per KWH!

# Imagine all of the things we would be able to do! Want more money? Add more panels, make more power!
# And on and on. Green tax incentives may make a project like this very lucrative.
